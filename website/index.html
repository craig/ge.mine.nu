<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2011-04-29]:</FONT> New blog: <A HREF="http://www.admlife.de">ADMinLIFE</A> <BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2011-04-13]:</FONT> New <A HREF="3dm2.html">3dm2</A> ebuild available.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2010-04-13]:</FONT> Fedora wants to add <A HREF="/lbd.html">lbd</A> to their repository. Here is the <A HREF="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=566404">bug</A>. They requested that I add the GPL disclaimer, as they thought GPL-v2 was not clear enough. So here is <A HREF="/code/lbd">lbd-0.2</A> which clearly states that Gnu General Public License version 2 is meant.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2009-11-06]:</FONT> Someone made a video about <A HREF="/lbd.html">load balancing detector</A>: <A HREF="http://www.securitytube.net/Detecting-DNS-and-HTTP-Load-Balancers-using-LBD-video.aspx">Securitytube video</A><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2009-03-18]:</FONT> Updated ebuild for <A HREF="3dm2.html">3dm2</A> available.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2009-01-17]:</FONT> <A HREF="./seagate-207931.html">seagate-207931-2.sh</A>: v2 available, automatically checks the serials<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2009-01-03]:</FONT> <A HREF="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/">25c3</A> was really cool! :) <BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2009-01-01]:</FONT> Happy new year! I'm sorry that I was so busy with other stuff last year, I'll try to change that...<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2008-01-30]:</FONT> <A HREF="http://www.s8s8.com/Soft/Soft_2236.htm">s8s8.com</A> mirrors <A HREF="arpcheck.html">arpcheck</A>.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2008-01-16]:</FONT> I filtered out some bots-download of my apps on their pages.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2008-01-13]:</FONT> Wow, I'm finally on my own hardware again! Thanks to MK for the hosting! I have retrieved the logfiles and analysing them, I found out that someone from the 24C3 IP-range has downloaded <A HREF="/mass-blue.html">mass-blue</A>. So I guess that's what was used to spam the congress-wiki picture all over the place via bluetooth...maybe by one of the peoples I told about the site? I have no clue why some phones seem to have crashed, though. Maybe because of a crappy bluetooth implementation that can't handle multiple connections?! Well, 24C3 was pretty cool! :) Now this site is back, come back soon!<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-11-16]:</FONT> Hello to the guys from citrix that searched for 3dm2 ebuilds.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-09-30]:</FONT> Hi to the people from <A HREF="http://www.sap.com">SAP</A> that viewed my <A HREF="/cccamp2007">cccamp2007</A> photos.<BR><BR>

It can be viewed <A HREF="https://www.prisma-mampu.gov.my/readM.jsp?index=msg00031.html&listname=newsletter&dat=2006-09">here</A>. Old news, I know, but I like listing it :)<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-09-12]:</FONT> Someone from <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</A> visited my page, I guess they searched for something like "hacking motorola", because they came from <A HREF="http://www.learnsecurityonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=150&Itemid=71">learnsecurityonline</A> where someone used my tool <A HREF=/lbd.html">lbd</A> on motorola.com.

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-04-17]:</FONT> My page is blocked in china and after adding Ale-x.com to my linklist, it also became blocked. Wow, that's strange. Maybe because he links to the <A HREF="http://tor.eff.org/">TOR network</A> projekt page?! Side-notice: <A HREF="http://www.ale-x.com">Ale-x</A> kind of stole my design.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-04-13]:</FONT> Added <A HREF="http://www.ale-x.com/">Ale-x's page</A> and <A HREF="http://www.adminlife.org">KMANs adminlife blog</A> to the <A HREF="links.html">links</A> page.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-04-12]:</FONT> New design. No more ugly PRE-tags (except for changelogs). No frames, simple layout. Hope you like it this way!<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-04-10]:</FONT> <IMG SRC="blocked-by-china-badge-english.png" ALT="a badge with the following text on it: officially blocked by the chinese government" ALIGN=right>I can't believe it. I read <A HREF="http://www.css-petals.net/post/im_netz_der_content_fischer.html9">"im Netz der Content-Fischer"</A> (an article about the chinese blocking certain web pages) and checked my own page then with <A HREF="http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/">www.greatfirewallofchina.org</A>. They block my page and I have no clue just why! Those chinese guys are mad.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-22]:</FONT> D'oh! 3Ware/AMCC released codeset 9.4.1 today. I'm going to write an ebuild for that. (EDIT: the new codeset is really crap!)<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-21]:</FONT> I wrote an ebuild for <A HREF="tw_firmware.html">3ware tw_firmware 9.4.0.1</A> today. I hope it will be added to portage soon!<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-20]:</FONT> New section: <A HREF="ebuilds.html">Gentoo / ebuilds</A>. I'll publish some stuff there.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-16]:</FONT> MDO from <a HREF="http://www.ordix.de">Ordix</A> had a talk about security and introduced my tool <A HREF="arpcheck.html">arpcheck</A>! :) I'm waiting for your ideas/bugfixes. I've already designed arpcheck-ng, but didn't really start coding yet. So any ideas are welcome.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-15]:</FONT> Over 500 downloads of <A HREF="lbd.html">Load Balancing Detector</A>! But after filtering out bots, only 374 downloads were left. :/<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-13]:</FONT> I sent a message to the mysql team, because their server allowed uploads from anyone to "ftp://ftp.mysql.com/pub/mysql/src"; imagine someone uploads a trojanized mysql version there! They thanked me and fixed it. Strange that no one noticed earlier.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2007-03-07]:</FONT> <A HREF="http://www.theadmins.info/">www.theadmins.info</A> wrote a short <A HREF="http://www.theadmins.info/forum/1944.html">tutorial</A> about my tool <A HREF="lbd.html">Load Balancing Detector</A>. Cool²! :)<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2006-12-21]:</FONT> I had to use 3dm2 on gentoo, so I modifed an existing ebuild to use the newest version. Click <A href="3dm2.html">here</A>, if you're interested on how to install the 9.4.0.1-ebuild. It worked fine with an "3ware Inc 9550SX SATA-RAID"<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2006-10-09]:</FONT> I've moved to Düsseldorf in Germany some weeks ago for a new job, thats why I was extremely busy in the last time. Also, I didn't have Internet and took a CCNA course in Dortmund which I shortened to 1 month (instead of 2). I succeeded of course ;) ...I didn't really move in my flat completely so stay tuned...new tools will be released in a few weeks or so :)<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2006-10-05]:</FONT> WOW, finally I've got REALLY fast Internet now (16 MBit)...don't (D)DOS me anyways ;)<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2006-03-23]:</FONT> I added some vhosts yesterday; apache needs to be restarted every time I reconnect - which I forgot to implement into my startscript. It resulted in ~3hrs downtime before I noticed. Sorry guys!<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIGHTGREEN>[2006-03-15]:</FONT> DAMN, <A HREF="http://www.frsirt.com">frsirt</A> closed the exploit & codes section. I don't like them anymore cause I think they just want to earn money :-P Use <A HREF="http://www.milw0rm.com/">milw0rm</A>!<BR><BR>
