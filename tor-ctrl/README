tor-ctrl is included in tor releases >= 0.2.0.9-alpha. Read the changelog. :)

Original commit: https://github.com/torproject/tor/commit/4807d8c9665aeaef4fece17495a0256745d6477c

tor-ctrl is a commandline tool for executing commands on a tor server via the controlport.
In order to get this to work, add "ControlPort 9051" and "CookieAuthentication 1" to your torrc and reload tor.
Or - if you want a fixed password - leave out "CookieAuthentication 1" and use the following line to create
the appropriate HashedControlPassword entry for your torrc (you need to change yourpassword, of course):
echo "HashedControlPassword $(tor --hash-password yourpassword | tail -n 1)"

tor-ctrl will return 0 if it was successful and 1 if not, 2 will be returned if something (telnet, xxd) is missing.
4 will be returned if it executed serveral commands from a file.

For setting the bandwidth for specific times of the day, I suggest calling tor-ctrl via cron, e.g.:

0 22 * * * /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"
0 7 * * *  /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=100kb"

This would set the bandwidth to 100kb at 07:00 and to 1mb at 22:00.
You can use notations like 1mb, 1kb or the number of bytes.

Switch to clean circuits, so new application requests don't share any circuits with old ones. Also clears the client-side DNS cache. (Tor MAY rate-limit its response to this signal.):

/path/to/tor-ctrl.sh -v -c "signal NEWNYM"


Many, many other things are possible, see tor's control-spec!

tor-ctrl v1 by Stefan Behte (http://ge.mine.nu)
You should have a look at http://tor.eff.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/control-spec.txt

usage: tor-ctrl [-switch] [variable]

               [-c] [command] = command to execute
                                notice: always "quote" your command

               [-f] [file]    = file to execute commands from
                                notice: only one command per line

               [-a] [path]    = path to tor's control_auth_cookie
                                default: /var/lib/tor/data/control_auth_cookie
                                notice: do not forget to adjust your torrc

               [-s] [var]     = sleep [var] seconds after each command sent
                                default: 1 second
                                notice: for GETCONF, you can use smaller pause times than for SETCONF
                                        this is due to telnet's behaviour.

               [-p] [var]     = Use password [var] instead of tor's control_auth_cookie
                                default: not used
                                notice: do not forget to adjust your torrc

               [-P] [var]     = Tor ControlPort
                                default: 9051

               [-v]           = verbose
                                default: not set
                                notice: the default output is the return code ;)
                                        You propably want to set -v when running manually

               Examples:      ./tor-ctrl.sh -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"
                              ./tor-ctrl.sh -v -c "GETINFO version"
                              ./tor-ctrl.sh -v -s 0 -P 9051 -p foobar -c "GETCONF bandwidthrate"
