#
# tor-ctrl is a commandline tool for executing commands on a tor server via the controlport.
# In order to get this to work, add "ControlPort 9051" and "CookieAuthentication 1" to your torrc and reload tor.
# Or - if you want a fixed password - leave out "CookieAuthentication 1" and use the following line to create
# the appropriate HashedControlPassword entry for your torrc (you need to change yourpassword, of course):
# echo "HashedControlPassword $(tor --hash-password yourpassword | tail -n 1)"
#
# tor-ctrl will return 0 if it was successful and 1 if not, 2 will be returned if something (telnet, xxd) is missing.
# 4 will be returned if it executed serveral commands from a file.
#
# For setting the bandwidth for specific times of the day, I suggest calling tor-ctrl via cron, e.g.:
# 0 22 * * * /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"
# 0 7 * * *  /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=100kb"
#
# This would set the bandwidth to 100kb at 07:00 and to 1mb at 22:00.
# You can use notations like 1mb, 1kb or the number of bytes.
#
# Many, many other things are possible, see http://tor.eff.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/control-spec.txt

# 2007-10-04: Renaming to "tor-ctrl", added a lot of functions, it's now a general-purpose tool
#             added control_auth_cookie/controlpassword auth, getopts, program checks, readinf from file etc.

tor-ctrl $VERSION by Stefan Behte (http://ge.mine.nu)
You should have a look at http://tor.eff.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/control-spec.txt 

usage: tor-ctrl [-switch] [variable]

               [-c] [command] = command to execute
				notice: always "quote" your command

               [-f] [file]    = file to execute commands from
	                        notice: only one command per line

               [-a] [path]    = path to tor's control_auth_cookie
	                        default: /var/lib/tor/data/control_auth_cookie
                                notice: do not forget to adjust your torrc

               [-s] [time]    = sleep [var] seconds after each command sent
	                        default: 1 second
				notice: for GETCONF, you can use smaller pause times than for SETCONF
				        this is due to telnet's behaviour.

               [-p] [pwd]     = Use password [var] instead of tor's control_auth_cookie
	                        default: not used
				notice: do not forget to adjust your torrc
				
               [-P] [port]     = Tor ControlPort
	                        default: 9051

               [-v]           = verbose
	                        default: not set
                                notice: the default output is the return code ;)
			                You propably want to set -v when running manually

               Examples:      $0 -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"
			      $0 -v -c "GETINFO version"
	                      $0 -v -s 0 -P 9051 -p foobar -c "GETCONF bandwidthrate"
